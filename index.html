                        <h3>Project 1: REM Trip Planner</h3>
                        <a><img src="assets/images/WP1_final_project.png" class="container"></img></a>
                        <p>
                            The final project for the Web Programming I course of the Fall 2021 semester was to design a hypothetical
                            trip
                            planning website for the (as yet unfinished) <a href="https://rem.info/en">REM train network</a>. The
                            website
                            leverages an API designed by the course's instructors to asynchronously populate several dropdown menus with
                            stations from the network, allowing the user to select start and end destinations for their trip. Once start
                            and
                            end destinations have been selected, and a departure time has been entered, the website will generate a
                            schedule
                            for the user's trip, detailing all stops they will make along their route, the estimated departure or
                            arrival
                            times at each stop, the direction in which they are traveling, the station's address and city, whether the
                            station has connections to any other public transportation networks, and any other notifications worth
                            noting.
                            It also makes use of an external <a href="https://developer.accuweather.com/">AccuWeather</a> API to provide
                            a
                            weather forecast for the user's intended destination.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The website's overall design is admittedly simplistic, and I have made significant improvements to my coding
                            style since I created it. Despite this, I am proud of the technical achievements the project represents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The repository for this project can be found at <a

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is worth noting that the REM API is inaccessible without a connection to the John Abbott College VPN.
                            Still,
                            the code can easily be modified to provide another API and fulfill a similar purpose.

                            The final project for the Game Programming course of the Fall 2022 semester is to design a Javascript-based
                            browser game of our choice. For this project, I have decided to create a game in the style of the Mega Man
                            franchise: a sidescrolling action game with several levels, which the player can challenge in any order.

                        <p>
                            The final project for the Web Programming II course of the Winter 2022 semester was a group project made in
                            collaboration with my classmates <a href="https://github.com/JeremyOroc">Jeremy Oroc</a> and <a
                                href="https://github.com/Julian-Hernandez1">Julian Hernandez</a>. Our task was to create a CRUD-based
                            transactional MVC web application on a topic of our choice. We chose to create a website called MediaMaster,
                            which would allow a user to log in and then enter, retrieve, update, and delete simple data about their
                            personal music collection. This data, along with the user account information and session tracking data, was
                            stored in a MySQL database running on a docker image.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My contributions to the project included the RUD functionality for the Songs model and controller; the
                            creation of associated views for each of these operations; the writing of unit tests and endpoint tests for
                            the same; and the implementation of tracking cookies, with an associated database model and tests. I also
                            created many of the project's JsDoc files.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was a challenging project, but we persevered, and I am proud of what we achieved in the time allotted
                            to us.

                            This assignment for the Application Development II course of the Fall 2022 semester was a solo effort to create an Android application which would allow Uber drivers to keep track of their trips.

                            The app allows the user to perform CRUD operations on Trips which are stored in a simple repository. The repository's contents are not saved anywhere, and it is loaded with sample data each time the app is run.
