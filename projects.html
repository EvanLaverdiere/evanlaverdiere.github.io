    <h1>My Projects</h1>

    <p>
        On this page you will find a list of projects that I have created in the course of the Computer Science Technology
        program. This is just a small selection of my creations, and I am particularly proud of them.
    </p>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Project 1: REM Trip Planner</h2>
        <a><img src="assets/images/WP1_final_project.png"></img></a>
        <p>
            The final project for the Web Programming I course of the Fall 2021 semester was to design a hypothetical trip
            planning website for the (as yet unfinished) <a href="https://rem.info/en">REM train network</a> . The website
            leverages an API designed by the course's instructors to asynchronously populate several dropdown menus with
            stations from the network, allowing the user to select start and end destinations for their trip. Once start and
            end destinations have been selected, and a departure time has been entered, the website will generate a schedule
            for the user's trip, detailing all stops they will make along their route, the estimated departure or arrival
            times at each stop, the direction in which they are traveling, the station's address and city, whether the
            station has connections to any other public transportation networks, and any other notifications worth noting.
            It also makes use of an external <a href="https://developer.accuweather.com/">AccuWeather</a> API to provide a
            weather forecast for the user's intended destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website's overall design is admittedly simplistic, and I have made significant improvements to my coding
            style since I created it. Despite this, I am proud of the technical achievements the project represents.
        </p>
        <p>
            he repository for this project can be found at <a
                href="https://github.com/EvanLaverdiere/3W5_Laverdiere_E">3W5_Laverdiere_E</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is worth noting that the REM API is inaccessible without a connection to the John Abbott College VPN. Still,
            the code can easily be modified to provide another API and fulfill a similar purpose.

        <h2>Project 2: Mega Man Clone</h2>
        <p>
            The final project for the Game Programming course of the Fall 2022 semester is to design a Javascript-based
            browser game of our choice. For this project, I have decided to create a game in the style of the Mega Man
            franchise: a sidescrolling action game with several levels, which the player can challenge in any order.
    
        </p>
        <p>The game is currently a work in progress.</p>

        <h2>
            Project 3: MediaMaster Website
        </h2>
        <p>
            The final project for the Web Programming II course of the Winter 2022 semester was a group project made in collaboration with my classmates <a href="https://github.com/JeremyOroc">Jeremy Oroc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Julian-Hernandez1">Julian Hernandez</a>. Our task was to create a CRUD-based transactional MVC web application on a topic of our choice. We chose to create a website called MediaMaster, which would allow a user to log in and then enter, retrieve, update, and delete simple data about their personal music collection. This data, along with the user account information and session tracking data, was stored in a MySQL database running on a docker image.
        </p>
        <p>
            My contributions to the project included the RUD functionality for the Songs model and controller; the creation of associated views for each of these operations; the writing of unit tests and endpoint tests for the same; and the implementation of tracking cookies, with an associated database model and tests. I also created many of the project's JsDoc files.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a challenging project, but we persevered, and I am proud of what we achieved in the time allotted to us. 
        </p>
