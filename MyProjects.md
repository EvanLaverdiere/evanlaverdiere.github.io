# My Projects

On this page you will find a list of projects that I have created in the course of the Computer Science Technology program. This is just a small selection of my creations, and I am particularly proud of them.

## Project 1

[Web Programming I Final Project](assets/images/WP1_final_project.png)

The final project for the Web Programming I course of the Fall 2021 semester was to design a hypothetical trip planning website for the (as yet unfinished) [REM train network](https://rem.info/en). The website leverages an API designed by the course's instructors to asynchronously populate several dropdown menus with stations from the network, allowing the user to select start and end destinations for their trip. Once start and end destinations have been selected, and a departure time has been entered, the website will generate a schedule for the user's trip, detailing all stops they will make along their route, the estimated departure or arrival times at each stop, the direction in which they are traveling, the station's address and city, whether the station has connections to any other public transportation networks, and any other notifications worth noting. It also makes use of an external [AccuWeather](https://developer.accuweather.com/) API to provide a weather forecast for the user's intended destination.

The website's overall design is admittedly simplistic, yet I am proud of the technical achievements it represents.

The repository for this project can be found at 3w5_Laverdiere_E.
